# Izak Lisp

This is my own (work-in-progress) implementation of a Lisp programming language. I am loosely following the "Make a Lisp" project found at https://github.com/kanaka/mal.

## Built-in functions

The built-in functions are "+", "-", "\*", "/", "count", "list", "list?", "empty?", "prn", "=", "<", ">", "<=", ">=", and "int?".

## Special forms

The impemented special forms are "def!", "let\*", "do", "if", and "fn\*".
